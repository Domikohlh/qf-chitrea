# Note
1. Original data have 20,206 na and 2 columns of  constant variance which has been removed
2. There is 2036 na remained amd 143 numerical columns that are not imputed by pmm for unknown reason (Maybe due to incomplete process). (R)
4. Tried running the pmm with 20 interations, but still ended up with 2036 na remained with unknown reason. (R)
5. The remaining na are replaced by 0. (R) 
6. PCA ran successfully (R)
7. Visualised the data in PCA (R)


# Reminder
1. Feel free to change anything if you have more details.
