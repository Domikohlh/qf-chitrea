# qf-chitrea
This is a github place for Alan and Dominic to work on the quantitative finance project in Chinese Treasury (qf-chitrea) for model prediction and training. 

# Current Progress
- Data preprocessing in R
- Data preprocessing in Python

# Objective
1. Quantitative model for bond
2. Insight into Chinese bond and interest rate and their prediction model in long-term
3. Time-series analysis

# Messages
- Dom: I might just pop up messages in here in case you have anything want to say related to the project/code when I am not online/available. 
- Dom: I may also update on anything when I get to some points or errors so we can discuss it in advance. 
- Dom: You can also leave messages/note/reminders at th bottom so we can get them highlighted. 


# Note
1. Original data have 20,206 na and 2 columns of  constant variance which has been removed
2. But the data ran pmm still has 2036 na remained. Needs to get in depth into that. Otherwise we cannot run PCA or even other ML model
3. There are 143 numerical columns that are not imputed by pmm for unknown reason.
4. Tried running the pmm with 20 interations, but still ended up with 2036 na remained with unknown reason.
5. Now trying to run the data in Python.


# Reminder
1. Can you give me more details about the data you gave me in the zip file and how could they be used? (Dom)
2. Feel free to change the objectives if you have anything more in-details
